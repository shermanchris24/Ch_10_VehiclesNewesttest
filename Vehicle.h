/*
 *
 Create a base class called Vehicle that has as properties:

-the manufacturerâ€™s name (type string),
-number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and
-owner (type Person, given below).

and methods:

-getters and setters for all properties (getManufacturer, getOwner, getCylinders, setManufacturer, setOwner, getCylinders)
-overloaded << operator
-default constructor - initialize the manufacture's name to "none", number of cylinders to 4, and the owner to a default Person
-parameterized constructor - passing a string owner name, string manufacturer name, and int cylinders.
    Use a constructor initialization list to initialize person object with the passed name like so:

 Vehicle::Vehicle(string the_name,string man_name, int num_cyl):owner(the_name)
